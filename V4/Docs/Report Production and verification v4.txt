: (File exists; actual content not yet checked)
Interpretation:

The current backtest output is NOT producing the expected signal_history or allocation_history data structures. This means the report generator cannot populate these tabs, and their absence is the root cause of tab/content verification failures.
The trade log and performance metrics sections appear to have some data, but further inspection is needed.
Next Steps:

Inspect the contents of 
trade_log.csv
s:\Dropbox\Scott Only Internal\Quant_Python_24\Backtest_FinAsset_Alloc_Template\v4_reporting\test_output\test_raw_data\trade_log.csv
 and 
performance_metrics.txt
 to verify what is being produced.
Trace back why signal_history and allocation_history are missing from backtest_resultsâ€”this is a critical data path issue that must be fixed at the source, not with a fallback.
Once the root data issue is fixed, rerun the extraction and confirm all required raw data files are populated.
Would you like to proceed with:

Reviewing the trade log and performance metrics contents,
Or begin tracing/fixing the missing signal/allocation history in the backtest logic?


Why not start with testing if you are even producing - in any form - the data output from the backtest engine that aligns to the unique data requirement and dataframes of each tab

write out in simple files - csv or logs or txt - what ever is easy to read and write for the AI - the raw data need

confirm make sense

Key Findings from References
1. CPS_V4_Master_Plan.md
V4 reporting modules (v4_performance_report.py, v4_allocation_report.py) are not yet implemented.
Phase 2 is focused on reporting and config-driven testing.
Emphasis on modular, isolated testing, fast feedback/fix loops, and AI-driven automation.
2. memory-bank/reporting_system_AI.md (V3 Reference)
V3 system included:
Adapter pattern for parameter flow.
Automated verification script (verify_v3_reporting.py) and batch wrapper.
Detailed output file standards (XLSX, PNG, CSV) and verification steps.
Parameter and signal history tracking.
Systematic troubleshooting and verification process is well-documented.
3. docs/Keep/report_standard_verification.md (Report Standards)
Defines the required structure, content, and formatting for reports:
File naming conventions
Sheet/tab structure and headers
Data/formatting requirements for each tab and graphic
Parameter flow verification checklist
Automated verification script requirements
Iterative Automated Report Test & Fix Loop: V4 Plan
1. Preparation
Implement or stub the target report module (e.g., v4_performance_report.py).
Ensure config and parameter flow is in place for the report to run in isolation.
2. Automated Test Harness
Create a test script (e.g., test_v4_report_generation.py) that:
Runs the report for a single configuration.
Captures and logs output file paths.
Invokes a verification script after report generation.
3. Verification Script
Implement verify_v4_report.py, modeled after V3's verify_v3_reporting.py, to:
Check for existence, size, and structure of output files.
Validate Excel tabs, headers, and data integrity.
Confirm parameter values appear in headers.
Compare against standards in 
report_standard_verification.md
.
Output a pass/fail result and detailed error/deviation report.
4. Automated Loop
If verification fails:
Parse the verification report for actionable errors.
Apply targeted fixes to report code or config.
Rerun the test and verification scripts.
If verification passes:
Mark the report as complete and proceed to the next.
5. Status Tracking
Maintain a log or status file tracking which reports have passed, failed, and what fixes were applied.
Example Workflow (Pseudo-Shell)
Run: python test_v4_report_generation.py --report performance
Script generates report, logs output.
Script calls: python verify_v4_report.py --file output/performance_report_YYYYMMDD.xlsx
If verification fails:
Script parses error log.
Developer (or AI) fixes code/config.
Repeat from step 1.
If verification passes:
Update status, move to next report.
Next Steps
Implement or stub the first V4 report module if not present.
Create the automated test harness and verification script.
Run the loop for the first report, using the verification template as a checklist.
Document results and update plan/status.
Would you like me to draft the skeleton for the test harness and verification script, or focus on a specific report module first? Let me know your preference for the next actionable step.
