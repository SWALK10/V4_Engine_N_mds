# **Allocation Data Flow Analysis for V4 Performance Reporting**

Based on my analysis of the code, here's how the allocation
data is created, tracked, and passed through the system:

- **1.
   Allocation Creation Process**

- **Signal
   Generation (EMA Allocation Model)**

- **File**: 

v4/models/ema_allocation_model_v4.py

- **Key
   Functions**:

- ema_allocation_model():
   Creates asset weights based on EMA technical indicators

- ema_allocation_model_updated():
   Wrapper that returns allocation with timestamp keys

- **Process**:

1.                Calculates EMA metrics using price data from the
backtest

2.                Ranks assets based on EMA metrics

3.                Determines allocation weights

4.                Returns a dictionary of allocations in
format: 

{date: {asset: weight}}

- **Signal
   Recording in Backtest Engine**

- **File**: 

v4/engine/backtest_v4.py

- **Key
   Method**: 

run_backtest()

- **Process**:
1. Receives
   raw price data
2. Calls
   signal generator (typically EMA model) on each date
3. Creates 

signal_history dictionary mapping dates to allocation
signals

4. Stores
   these desired allocations before any execution delay
- **2.
   Order Creation from Allocations**

- **File**: 

v4/engine/backtest_v4.py (imports 

v4/engine/allocation.py

)

- **Key
   Component**: 

calculate_rebalance_orders()

- **Process**:
1. Compares
   current weights from portfolio with target weights from signals

2. Creates
   buy/sell orders to match target weights

3. Applies
   rebalancing frequency rules
- **3.
   Order Execution and Tracking**

- **File**: 

v4/engine/execution_v4.py

- **Key
   Method**: 

execute_orders()

- **Process**:
1. Applies
   slippage and commission models
2. Executes
   sell orders first to free up cash
3. Executes
   buy orders with potential quantity adjustments
4. Creates
   trade objects recording actual executed trades
5. Updates
   portfolio state based on trades
- **4.
   Portfolio State Management**
- **File**: 

v4/engine/portfolio_v4.py

- **Key
   Methods**:

- update_from_trade()

- get_weights()

- mark_to_market()

- **Process**:

1.                Maintains current positions and cash balance

2.                Records portfolio history and snapshots
(including weights)

3.                Calculates actual asset weights after trades are
executed

- **5.
   Final Allocation History Creation**

- **File**: 

v4/engine/backtest_v4.py

- **Key
   Method**: 

_calculate_results()

- **Process**:
1. Compiles
   a 

weights_history

 dictionary showing how allocations evolved

2. Transforms
   this considering execution delay
3. Returns 

weights_history

 as part of the backtest results dictionary

- **6.
   Reporting Access to Allocation Data**

- **File**: 

v4_reporting/v4_performance_report.py

- **Key
   Methods**:

- generate_performance_report()

- _export_allocation_history()

- **Process**:

1.                Receives backtest results containing 

weights_history

2.                Uses this to create allocation reports in
Excel/CSV formats

3.                The allocation history should contain timestamp
keys with ticker-weight dictionaries

- **Current
   Issue: Missing Allocation History**

The likely issue is that when the reporting module tries to
access 

backtest_results['weights_history']

, this key is not present or contains invalid data.

- **Verification
   Steps**
1. Check
   if 

weights_history

 is properly populated in 

_calculate_results() in backtest_v4.py

2. Verify
   that the structure of the weights_history matches what the reporting
   functions expect
3. Add
   logging statements at key points to track the allocation data flow
- **Debugging
   Approach**
1. Add
   print/log statements to verify allocation data structure at each step
2. Create
   a test script that runs through the complete allocation flow
3. Use
   simple, clear data structures like CSV/TXT for intermediate validation
4. Compare
   expected vs. actual data structure at each step
- **Easy
   Ways for AI to Track and Verify Each Step**
1. **Add
   debug export points**: Insert CSV/TXT export for allocation data at each
   major transformation point
2. **Use
   simple test cases**: Create a simplified test with 2-3 assets to make
   data examination easier
3. **Create
   visualization utilities**: Add simple plots of allocation changes over
   time
4. **Add
   structured logging**: Create specific logs focusing on allocation data
   flow
5. **Implement
   schema validation**: Add validation checks to ensure allocation data
   structure remains consistent

This analysis should help pinpoint exactly where the
allocation history data is being lost or malformed in the process.

**Root cause analysis logging and diagnostics have been added to** 

**run_backtest in 

backtest_v4.py.**

### What was changed:

- Before returning results, the code now checks if 
  
  ```
  weights_history
  ```
  
   is 
  
  ```
  None
  ```
  
  , empty, or all zeros/NaN.

- If any issue is found, it writes a detailed debug log to 
  
  ```
  debug_allocation_history/weights_history_debug.txt
  ```
  
   (created in your project root).

- A sample of the first 10 rows is always logged for inspection.

- An error is logged if a problem is detected; otherwise, it logs that 
  
  ```
  weights_history
  ```
  
   appears valid.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Re-run your backtest as usual (using your standard .bat or test runner).**

2. **Check the contents of 
   
   ```
   debug_allocation_history/weights_history_debug.txt
   ```
   
   ** after the run:
   
   - If there is a problem, the file will contain a description and a sample of the data.
   - If the file says "ALL ZEROS" or "EMPTY", the root cause is likely in signal generation, portfolio value, or trade execution.
   - If the file shows valid weights, the issue is likely downstream (in reporting or export).
